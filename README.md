## Firebase Integration
The app uses Firebase to store and manage expense data. Firebase provides a cloud-based backend that ensures the app is scalable and user-friendly. Below are the Firebase services integrated into the app:

## Firebase Realtime Database:

- Used to save expense data securely.
- Ensures data is synced in real-time across multiple devices.
- Firebase Authentication (Optional):

- Provides user authentication to enable personalized expense tracking (if required).
## Firebase Configuration:

The Firebase SDK is integrated into the app.
Firebase credentials are stored securely in the app configuration file.
## Technologies Used
React Native: Framework for cross-platform mobile app development.
Firebase: Backend-as-a-Service for real-time data storage and management.
JavaScript: Primary programming language for the app.
Redux: Used for state management to handle expense-related data.
## ## Packages Used
This project uses the following key packages:

react: Core React library for building user interfaces.
react-native: React Native library for mobile app development.
firebase: SDK to connect the app with Firebase services.
redux: State management library for managing app-wide state.
@react-navigation/native: Enables screen navigation.
react-native-screens: Optimizes navigation performance.
react-native-gesture-handler: Handles user gestures and touch interactions.
expo: Toolset for building React Native apps with ease.




# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
